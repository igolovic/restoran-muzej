# restoran-muzej
Web-site I created in 2009. for a restaurant. I also implemented a possibility for user to enter daily menu in private part which was then displayed in a public part of website since user wanted to change this menu himself every day. Web-site uses PHP, MySQL, Smarty template engine and Highslide Javascript gallery, TinyMCE HTML editor.
